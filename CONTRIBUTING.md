# ABibliaDigital Contributing Guide

Before submitting your contribution please read the guidelines.

- [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Commit Guidelines

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Do not create questions. The issue list is exclusively for reports, bugs and feature requests. Use the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarciovsena) instead.

- Always search for your issue first. It may have already been answered, planned or fixed in some branch. New features will be planned on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/VPGRzM36).

- Only create issues for the newest version.

- Create a declarative title and describe clearly the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 3 days, it will be closed.

- If you want to show your code please use [Codepen](http://codepen.io/pen/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

- In case you found a solution by yourself try to explain how you fixed it. It could be useful for somebody else. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Make small commits as you work on the PR. They will be automatically squashed before merging.

- Provide convincing reason to add a new feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion/request issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add the GitHub ID to your commit. E.g. `(fix something really ugly #xxx)`
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR.
